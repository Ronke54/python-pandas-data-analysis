## Getting Started
To use the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have a working installation of Python and Jupyter Notebook. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install jupyter`. You will also need to install pandas library by running `pip install pandas`, matplotlib and seaborn library if you want to use it for visualization.

Once you have the necessary software installed, you can clone or download this repository to your local machine. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter Notebook application.

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the Working with Pandas repository and open the notebook files to begin working through the tutorials.
